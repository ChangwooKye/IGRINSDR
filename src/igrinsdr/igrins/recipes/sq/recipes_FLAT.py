def makeProcessedFlat(p: Igrins):
    """
    This recipe takes flat images and reduce them to prepare a processed flat image.
    The raw input should have both flat on and off images. The flat off and images are
    separatedly combined into a single stacked flat off and a stacked flat on image,
    then subtracted. For each order, an average spectrum is estimated as
    a function of columns (x-pixels) and the pixels belong in that order are nomarlized
    by the average spectrum. This is saved as a processed flat. The recipe will
    identify upp and lower boundary of each order and which is added to the processed flat
    with an extention of a "SLITEDGE" as a table. The combined flat before the normalization
    is also stored with an extension name of "FLAT_ORIGINAL".
